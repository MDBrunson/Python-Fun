# Fun-Python
These are just fun things I have made in Python


The name maker and mad libs just asks for terminal input. Nothing more to it. 

The projectile motion calculator was just me playing around with the python UnitRegistry library. It assumes a flat earth, constant gravity, constant mach number, everything in ideal physics world. The original birthplace was a calculation of the angle a baseball pitcher would have to throw a ball. Since they are throwing slightly downhill, if they throw fast enough, they can actually throw at a downward angle. Most people would have to throw at an upward angle though. Throwing something 1 foot in front of you should be easy... unless the ball needs to reach the target in 1 year. Then you have to throw it practically vertical, hard enough that the earth chenges velocity.
